#
# On image booted machines, we need to mount /boot from the image-specific
# boot directory so that kernel package installation will put the
# files in the right place.  We also have to mount /boot/grub from the
# system-wide grub directory so that tools that edit the grub.cfg
# file will find it in the expected location.
